Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Add a tour feature similar to what the ``project`` module defines to
   discover projects / tasks.
-  Update portal tests defined in ``tests/test_portal.py`` to rely on
   tour specs (in JS) in order to replicate the navigation behavior of
   portal users.

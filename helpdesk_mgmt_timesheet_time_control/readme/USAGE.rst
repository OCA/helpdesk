In general the usage instructions from ``project_timesheet_time_control`` apply with the following additions.

Via helpdesk tickets:

#. Go to *Helpdesk > All Tickets*.
#. If a ticket has a running timesheet line, it will display a *Stop* button.
#. Other tickets that have enabled timesheets will display a *Start* button
   that will open the same wizard as the timesheet lines, duplicating task's
   last timesheet line.
#. You can see the same in list view.
#. Click on any existing ticket or create a new one.
#. You can see the same feature in the action buttons box.
#. On the *Timesheets* page, you will be able to handle records the same way
   as you do in the above explanation (except the ticket selection part, which
   in this case doesn't appear as it's the current one).

Note: All the *Start/Resume/Stop* features are disabled if you don't belong to
the *Timesheets/User* group or if you are viewing a timesheet that belongs
to another user.
